# MWD-220P Final Project
MWD 220P Final Project
This project uses Yahoo Finance data to create a line chart that displays the stock trends from December 2019-December 2020 with the visualization interactivity of a tooltip feature. This feature allows the user to see the exact data and date of each point when they however over the line. 

Firstly, the main step was to find .csv data that fit the criteria placed on the project. This Amazon stock data set from Yahoo has more than 4 columns and more than 20 rows. 

The next step was to go about filtering the data to get only the columns that I needed to create the line Chart.

Once the data was filtered through using the return function, I was able to start adding the necessary d3 code in order to construct the line chart model.

Once a line was able to be seen, I then needed to add the necessary code that would allow for the user to be able to use the tooltip feature.
